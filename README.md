## Abstract
**Research Objective:**
Among children and adolescents all over the US including Arkansas, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and conduct disorder (CD) are common behavioral disorders. These behavioral disorders have significant public health impacts as they impede the social, emotional, and personal development of children and adolescents that can carry forward into adulthood and have negative health and financial implications. This study aimed to estimate the updated prevalence of ADHD, ODD, and CD and evaluate the prevalence trends from 2013 to 2019 among Arkansas children and adolescents utilizing All-Payer Claims Database (APCD).

**Study Design:**
In this retrospective cross-sectional study, member enrollment and medical claims data from Arkansas APCD were analyzed. Data till 2019 was included considering that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the health systems including the diagnosis and treatment services of behavioral disorders among children and adolescents. ADHD, ODD, and CD identified using valid diagnosis codes were the outcome measures. Diagnosis of any of these behavioral disorders was separately coded as having any behavioral disorders. Univariate analysis was performed to identify the prevalence estimates of the concerning behavioral disorders and their distribution across socio-demographic characteristics. A logistic regression model was used to assess the prevalence trend over time. Age, sex, and insurance coverage were the covariates. The statistical significance level considered in this study was Î±=0.05.

**Population Studied:**
Arkansas children and adolescents aged 4-17 years during individual study years were the study population. Having medical coverage and being enrolled in a plan for at least a day in the concerning year were two additional inclusion criteria. In total 3,186,092 children were included over the period January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2019.

**Principal Findings:**
Among the 456,929 children and adolescents aged 4-17 years in 2019 in Arkansas, the prevalence estimates of ADHD, ODD, CD, and any behavioral disorders were 11.2% (95% CI, 11.1-11.3), 2.4% (95% CI, 2.3-2.4), 4.3% (95% CI, 4.25-4.4), and 13.5% (95% CI, 13.4-13.6) respectively. Across all these behavioral disorders there were statistically significant differences (p<.0001) in the prevalence according to sex, age, and insurance coverage. From 2013 to 2019 there was an upward though insignificant trend in ADHD prevalence (10.7% in 2013 to 11.2% in 2019), a downward significant trend in both ODD (3.6% in 2013 to 2.4% in 2019) and CD (5% in 2013 to 4.3% in 2019) prevalence. For all three behavioral disorders across all subgroups by sex, age, and insurance coverage (except private insurance for the case of ODD and CD), the prevalence trend changed significantly in the same direction as the respective overall trends.

**Conclusions:**
Findings of this study indicate that among Arkansas children and adolescents, the prevalence estimate of ADHD increased between 2013 and 2019 while the prevalence estimates of ODD and CD decreased during the same period. Further research is warranted to identify risk factors that differently influence particular behavioral disorders.

**Implications for Policy or Practice:**
This study can help identify vulnerable populations and develop targeted interventions. Furthermore, it can provide evidence ground to evaluate the usefulness of school nutrition programs in Arkansas in terms of improving the mental health of children and adolescents.
